After sequencing samples from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), I tested the code for accuracy in extracting data from Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing reports. Following a few tests and modifications, the code now works effectively, allowing us to extract sequencing data for each sample without manual entries as previously required.
