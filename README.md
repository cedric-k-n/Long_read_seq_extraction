#After sequencing samples from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), I tested the code for accuracy of data extraction from OXford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing report.
#Following a few tests and modifications the code works effectively, and we can extract sequencing data for each samples without doing mannual entries as previously done.
